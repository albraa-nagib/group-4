 * Project: University Course Management System
 
 * Description:
 * This project is a simple Java-based University Course Management System.
 * It demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as
 * abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
 
 * The system manages different types of users including Students,
 * Instructors, and Admins. Each user type has its own attributes and
 * behaviors while sharing common functionality through an abstract
 * parent class.
 
 * The Main class is used to test the system by creating objects,
 * adding them to the user manager, and displaying their information.
